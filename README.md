<h1 align=center>Introduction</h1>

<code>Hi and welcome to my github profile. I am a computer engineering student at <b color=blue>Technological University Dublin</b>. I have many different intrests within the generalised umbrella term of computer engineering. I do not claim to be an expert in any particular topic, I tend to enjoy exploring many different concepts some in more detail than others. I believe that no task is too challenging to achieve, it is solely based on our own motivation to work towards it.
